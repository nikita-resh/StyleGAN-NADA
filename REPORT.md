# Work Report

### What Worked:

- Implemented loss function classes: `l2_loss`, `clip_loss`, `clip_directional_loss`
- Developed a domain adaptation pipeline
- Applied domain adaptation to real-world images
- Implemented layer freezing (only updating a subset of layers during generator training)
- Created a Colab notebook with numerous parameters for experiments

### Strengths of the Approach:

- No training dataset required
- Generator optimization only takes a few minutes
- The generator is trained directly, not the latent space, allowing for the generation of an unlimited number of images in the target domain after training
- Thanks to `clip_directional_loss`, only the necessary changes are applied

### Drawbacks of the Approach:

- A generator pre-trained on a large dataset of images is still required, limiting flexibility and efficiency
- The quality of generated images is highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, meaning there is no "one-size-fits-all" solution
- Some classes are not represented in the CLIP dataset, preventing domain adaptation for those specific classes
- The model can suffer from overfitting to the training data or mode collapse, leading to a lack of diversity in the generated images

### Areas for Improvement:

- Build a library of off-the-shelf styles for instant generation
- Develop a web service to expose the application
- Improve inversion: combine encoder and latent optimization to balance encoder speed with the ability to retain details through latent optimization
- Add support for working with classes beyond human faces
- Introduce additional loss functions to reduce artifacts
- Automatically select input prompts and weights on the fly using CLIP: instead of manual input, use a predefined set of classes and determine the best input prompt and associated weights based on image-text similarity
